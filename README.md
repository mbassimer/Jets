The menu allows the users to create their own jet to add to the collection or remove. This program shows the ability for Java to retain data and allot to a designated array list.

## Lessons learned

Lessons learned throughout this program is that whenever; the program is working there is always more things you can do to make it stand apart. I was able to complete this program before the deadline, not by much but still on time. The future assignments I hope to be able to broaden my coding skill by adding specialties to the complete project. Also the why interfaces are utilized to create a thoroughfare for abstract classes. I think it took this project for me to realize their importance.  

## UML Diagrams

The UML Diagram for this project was very distinct. I had to make sure to double check all of the relationships between classes multiple times in order to have the design directly inline with specifications. I can for see that many of the projects within the working field probably live and die by these diagrams. They are extraordinarily helpful and allow the coder to get a definitive understanding of whats being undertaken to the highest amount of detail.
